Delinquent History of a Fictitious Auto Loan Owner: Customer #2355910
Introduction
Customer #2355910, a 38-year-old warehouse supervisor living in Dayton, Ohio, first took out an
auto loan in July 2019 to purchase a a used automobile. The loan, issued by Riverbank Auto
Finance, totaled $21,500 with a five-year term and an interest rate of 6.5%. This document outlines
The customer's loan history, his path to delinquency, contributing factors, and how his case was
managed by the lender.
Loan Origination and Early Payments
At the time of the loan origination, The customer had a solid employment history, an average credit
score of 660, and no prior delinquencies. His monthly auto loan payment was $419, and for the first
year, he made all payments on time. He set up automated debits from his checking account and
maintained a steady financial routine.
However, in late 2020, the pandemic began to affect his income. While he was not laid off, his hours
were cut significantly, and he experienced a temporary reduction in take-home pay. Though he still
managed to meet his financial obligations, the strain began to accumulate.
First Signs of Delinquency
In March 2021, The customer missed his first auto loan payment. The missed payment was the
result of a medical emergency for his son, which required him to divert funds from his loan payment
toward hospital expenses. He contacted Riverbank Auto Finance within a week to explain the
situation.
The lender offered The customer a one-month deferment, pushing his March payment to the end of
his loan term. This solution helped temporarily, but it also set the stage for future problems. Although
he resumed payments in April and May, the stress of juggling obligations took a toll.
Increasing Delinquency
In July 2021, The customer missed a second payment. This time, it was due to an unexpected car
repair and rent increase. Again, he contacted the lender, and Riverbank offered a modified payment
plan that would lower his monthly payment to $350 for three months, with the difference added to
the principal.
The customer agreed, but by October, he had fallen behind again-this time missing two consecutive
payments. By November 2021, his account was officially 60 days delinquent. At this stage,
Riverbank's internal collections team stepped in for more structured outreach.
Collections and Communication
The collections team contacted The customer by phone and email to discuss his options. The
customer expressed his intention to pay but admitted that he had taken on a second job to make
ends meet. The team reviewed his income and expenses and offered to restructure the loan under a
hardship program.
A new plan was agreed upon: The customer would resume $350 monthly payments for six months,
after which his payments would revert to the original schedule. The restructured plan also reset his
delinquency status.
Temporary Recovery
From December 2021 to May 2022, The customer made his payments on time. He showed signs of
financial recovery, having adjusted to his second job and reduced discretionary spending. His
account was once again in good standing, and his credit score began to stabilize.
However, by July 2022, The customer began missing payments again, citing burnout from working
two jobs and increased expenses due to inflation. This time, he went 90 days past due without
initiating contact with Riverbank. The lender escalated his case to an external collections agency.
Repossession and Aftermath
By October 2022, after 120 days of non-payment and no response to repeated contact attempts,
Riverbank initiated repossession proceedings. The customer's automobile was repossessed in early
November.
After the automobile was sold at auction for $9,800, a deficiency balance of $5,900 remained on the
loan. Riverbank sent a formal notice to The customer, offering payment arrangements for the
remaining balance. The customer contacted the lender in December, explaining that he had suffered
a mental health breakdown and was now receiving treatment.
Resolution Strategy
Given the updated context and The customer's cooperation, Riverbank agreed to a settlement plan.
The customer would pay $2,500 over the next 12 months in exchange for the remaining deficiency
balance being forgiven. The agreement was documented and signed by both parties.
The customer made consistent payments through 2023, ultimately satisfying the settlement terms in
November 2023. His credit report reflected the settled account, marked as "Paid for less than full
balance."
Analysis and Lessons Learned
Customer #2355910's delinquency history reflects a common story of middle-income borrowers
facing compounding life stressors. Initially reliable and communicative, The customer's ability to
maintain his loan obligations deteriorated due to external pressures-medical emergencies, job
instability, inflation, and mental health challenges.
From the lender's perspective, Riverbank Auto Finance followed best practices:
- Early intervention after first missed payment
- Offering deferments and restructuring options
- Legal and ethical compliance in collections
- Prioritizing human factors during hardship
The resolution was not ideal-repossession and partial loss-but it was handled professionally and
respectfully. The customer, for his part, demonstrated honesty and eventual responsibility.
Conclusion
Delinquency on auto loans does not always reflect irresponsibility. As seen in Customer
#2495969764's case, it can stem from a complex mix of life events and economic conditions.
Lenders and borrowers alike benefit when empathy, communication, and flexibility are prioritized.
While The customer's credit suffered, he also learned valuable financial lessons and rebuilt his life
with support from his lender and community.
